# Macroeconomics

Notes and codes on macroeconomics.

## Contents

This repository can be mainly divided into three parts: `notes`, `codes`, and `appendix`.

- `notes` include various topics in macroeconomic theory and tools.
- `codes` include programming codes that implement computational methods to solve macroeconomic problems.
- `appendix` is for the mathematical completeness of the notes. While we go through important features of mathematical tools in `notes`, for more detailed description you can refer to `appendix`. 

Below is the list of topics covered (or to be upated) in each section.

### Notes

- The Solow Model
- The Neoclassical Growth Model
- Deterministic Dynamic Programming in Discrete-Time
- Stochastic Dynamic Programming in Discrete-Time
- Deterministic Dynamic Programming in Continous-Time
- Stochastic Dynamic Programming in Continuous-Time

### Codes

### Appendix

- Differential and Difference Equations
